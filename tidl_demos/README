# TIDL Integration to ONNX Runtime

## Execution Provider
The core of the execution proivder can be found [HERE](https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/users/a0226847/repos/onnxruntime/browse/onnxruntime/core/providers/tidl). Checkout [THIS REPO DIFF](https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/users/a0226847/repos/onnxruntime/compare/diff?targetBranch=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster&sourceBranch=refs%2Fheads%2Ftidl_xp&targetRepoId=33757) for a full description of what files need to be changed to add TIDL support to ONNX Runtime.

This execution provider is heavily based on the DNNL execution provider, which relies on Intel's library which gets built and linked from here: `ORT_HOME/build/Linux/RelWithDebInfo/dnnl/install`. This gets cloned/built during the long and complicated Cmake build process, I would imagine something similar will need to be added for TIDL libs.

## Building ONNX Runtime
You should be able to just run ./tidl_build.sh in this directory. Cmake must be installed.
